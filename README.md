# Welcome to the D&D Character Management project! #

This project has been built for users to add their D&D campaign characters to. They can then further manage these characters by editing them, players can decalre their character 'dead' and this will allow them to remove their character from the list.

## UX #

This project has a mobile first approach. The website provides a clear and approachable format for all users, regardless of device or resolution. You can add/edit/remove characters from the character list as all elements will resize. The user will also be able to navigate around the site using the nav bar, this will show as top bar in desktop, and as a burger menu in mobile.

### User Stories #

* As a user I want to be able to add common D&D character information to a record.
* As a user I want to know whether my character is still alive or is dead.
* As a user I want to be able to edit my character if my stats have changed / have decided to change their name.
* As a user I want to know more information about the site creator / D&D.

### Features #

Here you can find a list of available features from the Big Shmeck website.

* Add character records along with their associated class, race and stats
* Edit character records to update their information throughout the campaign
* View character records to see information presented on the web site
* Remove character records when a character has died

### Further Functionality #

Further functionality I would like to add in the future includes but is not limited to:

* Edit / remove classes
* Edit / remove races
* Pagination on Home

### Wireframes #

The initial wireframe for this project was formed from the Thorin and his company of dwarves mini project. This shows in the similarities between the 2 projects.

I also did an initial concept as a drawing and showed this to my mentor and he agreed that this was a suitable layout.

Links were also discussed with my mentor and I agreed that ease of use through 'go to' and 'back' navigation buttons were definitely the best options to include.

The idea to add a burger menu in the mobile view was added later on in the creation as this was not initially thought through by myself.

The bin icon being added after a character is killed was added at the very last moment as it seemed a very thematic and fitting idea to remove the character, but only after they had been incapacitated.

### Deployment #

Deployment was done initially through GitHub, when I checked that everything was coming through correctly, I then deployed to Heroku.

Deployment was completed regularly throughout the project as a form of backup if anything were to go wrong with my local version.

You can see evidence of my regular deployments in GitHub and Heroku.

### Testing #

Testing was completed as developed, through trial and error, with a main all encompassed test at the very end to make sure that all links were functional and that all general functionality worked as expected.

The testing methods included checking that user navigation was fluid i.e. all links worked correctly and allowed for accessing the previously accessed page and the home page. 

Other testing included allowing family and friends to view the site from Heroku and provide feedback which I then worked around as and when this was spoken about.

Another form of very helpful testing was completed by the Code Institute support team as they were helping me write this project. A member of the team named Tim pointed out that the site did not look very personalised when initially viewing, I changed the site to include a footer that included contact details and links to point to my socials and GitHub repos.
