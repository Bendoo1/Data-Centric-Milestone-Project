# Welcome to the D&D Character Management project! #

This project has been built for users to add their D&D campaign characters to. They can then further manage these characters by editing them, players can decalre their character 'dead' and this will allow them to remove their character from the list.

## UX #

This project has a mobile first approach. The website provides a clear and approachable format for all users, regardless of device or resolution. You can add/edit/remove characters from the character list as all elements will resize. The user will also be able to navigate around the site using the nav bar, this will show as top bar in desktop, and as a burger menu in mobile.

### User Stories #

* As a user I want to know whether my character is still alive or is dead.
* As a user I want to be able to edit my character if my stats have changed / have decided to change their name.
* As a user I want to know more information about the site creator / D&D.
